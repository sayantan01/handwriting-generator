# handwriting-generator
System that generates handwritten pdf from any text file

## System synopsis
We feed an image of our own handwriting <a href="https://github.com/sayantan01/handwriting-generator/blob/main/sample.jpeg">sample.jpeg</a> (to this system. The system extracts and separates each and every character from the handwriting and maps them to english characters. After that, if we provide any text file as input, the system will generate a pdf containing the exact same content of the text file, but the pdf will be generated in your own handwriting <a href="https://github.com/sayantan01/handwriting-generator/blob/main/output/mypdf.pdf">mypdf.pdf</a>.
